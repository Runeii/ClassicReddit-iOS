## Rationale

Whatever topic you are searching for today, chances are one of the top results is a Reddit link. There's also a lot of great, crowd sourced information available on there, once you veer away from the popular subreddits.

But to access any of it on a mobile phone, generally you need to create an account and now also download the Reddit app. Without these two things, the site is a pit of dark patterns, popups, and barely usable.

This plugin:

*  Automatically swaps out any Reddit link with the "old" design Reddit link. It's not pretty, but you can actually read text!
*  Applies a series of basic CSS tweaks to display bettter on mobile devices. These include removing popups, adjusting element layout to fit portrait screens, and compress comment threads.
*  By default hides the sidebar and adds a button to toggle its visibility as and when needed
*  Generally focuses on making the content front and centre
